To run the Connect Four game in Alpine Linux, We set up Alpine inside my Ubuntu virtual machine. After installing gcc and required packages, We copied the connect_four.c source file, compiled it using gcc connect_four.c -o connect_four, and executed it with ./connect_four. The program successfully launched in Alpine. Moreover, We configured the system so that when the virtual machine boots, the Connect Four game runs automatically, ensuring direct access to the game without additional commands.
